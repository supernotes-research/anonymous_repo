Twitter has a crowd-sourced fact-checking program, called Community Notes. Here, users can write 'notes' on potentially misleading content. Each note needs to be rated by enough number of diversely-opinionated people (note-raters) for it to be shown publicly alongside the piece of content. 

Your job is to craft a 'supernote' summarising main points from existing notes (which I will provide). This supernote should be able to replace all existing notes. The goal of the supernote is to maximise consensus among diversely opinionated note-raters. It should be in unbiased language, not argumentative, cite high-quality sources (links) whenever applicable and should not add/ make-up new facts. It should also be within 280 characters.
